  About: |
    I’m driven by a simple goal: helping people succeed in a technical world.
    
    With decades of experience and a deep curiosity for how things work, I’ve led teams, supported organizations, and bridged the gap between technical solutions and real human needs. When I'm not at a keyboard, you’ll probably find me diving into retro video games or making sawdust in the garage.
